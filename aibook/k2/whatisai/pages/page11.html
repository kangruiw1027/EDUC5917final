    Good collaboration requires mutual selection and clear communication. AI will also adjust its output based on the ‘social signals’ we provide (such as tone, politeness, and details). The significance of making flexible use of AI lies in cultivating children’s ‘leadership’—how to clearly express their intentions and drive collaboration.”

    In our book, we will use the example of a child interacting with AI in two emotional states: happiness and frustration."
    Instead of just giving data, the AI responds to the child's emotion first. This demonstrates that AI could imitate social cues of how humans interact with each other.
    AI shouldn't just be a cold tool; it's a collaborative partner."
